## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham-393/django_project.git
cd django_project


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies:

- Create a virtual environment:

  bash
  python -m venv env
  

- Activate the virtual environment:

  - On Windows:

    bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    

  - On macOS/Linux:

    bash
    source env/bin/activate
    

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Set Up the Database

If you're using the default SQLite database:

- Make Migrations:

  bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  

- Migrate:

  bash
  python manage.py migrate
  

### 5. Create a Superuser (Optional)

If you want access to the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

bash
python manage.py createsuperuser


### 6. Run the Development Server

bash
python manage.py runserver


You can now access the project in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
